# Choosing a terminal
You'll need to use a terminal program to interact with CSCT Cloud, all operating systems come with at least one, there are also other third party terminal terminal applications you can use.

## Windows
Windows includes two terminal programs by default - PowerShell and Command Prompt - it's recommended you use PowerShell, you can launch this from the start menu (press the ++windows++ key and search for it).

Microsoft offer [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/){:target="_blank"} which acts as a wrapper around other terminal programs on your computer, offering useful features like tabs and panes and better text customisation.

It is also possible to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, using [Windows Sybsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about){:target="_blank"} - supporting you with the installation and setup of this is beyond the scope of this guide however.

## macOS
macOS comes with [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/welcome/mac){:target="_blank"}, you can launch this from Spotlight - use ++cmd+space++ and search.

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Hyper](https://hyper.is/){:target="_blank"} are good terminal programs, but there are many [alternatives available](https://github.com/cdleon/awesome-terminals?tab=readme-ov-file#macos){:target="_blank"}.

## Linux
Your distribution will come with at least one terminal program, often just called `terminal`, but will possibly include several programs - pick one!
