**Old troubleshooting content to be turned into new pages in the documentation**

## Troubleshooting
### Azure CLI access denied
Normally means they installed it using winget whilst still in Powershell as an administrator

To remove it: `winget uninstall --exact --id Microsoft.AzureCLI` in an administrative powershell window.

Then in a normal powershell window: `winget install --exact --id Microsoft.AzureCLI`.

If they had already added ssh extension then will need to remove it in admin powershell window (`az extension remove -n ssh`) then try reconnecting in a normal powershell window.

### raygui webpage refuses to load
Web page refuses to load at all on a specific machine (but can be loaded on a different machine by manually forwarding the port)

Can verify issue by trying to open the web page with cURL - will see the request fail with bytes unread (ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH).

* Open settings and search for `remote.ssh.useExecServer` and untick (setting it to false)
* Restart vscode
* Try again

[Github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/9548)

**This sometimes happened when somebody else on the server was trying to use the same port - get them to re-run the port generating script and try again**

### Permission denied (publickey)
If an SSH config exists (it'll be created when they first setup a connection through vscode), open it up and check:
* User is their full UWE email address (including host portion), spelt correctly, all in lowercase
* Host is `csctcloud.uwe.ac.uk` (spelt correctly)
* IdentityFile correctly points to a key on OneDrive (and path is properly quoted), or on personal machines to `C:\Users\X\.ssh\id_rsa`, `/Users/X/.ssh/id_rsa`, or `/home/X/.ssh/id_rsa` (or another properly created keyfile if they've chosen a non-default location), or is omitted (so default keyfile used)

If this is all correct/they haven't got to setting up vscode yet:
* Look in their `.ssh` folder (check this matches what is in SSH config) and check both public and private key are present
* If they don't have a `.ssh` folder - get them to go back to 'Generating a key' section of guide and go from there
* Open up public key in notepad and check not malformed or accidentally overwritten

Get them to connect to the server using Azure CLI (`az login`):
* Have they created the .ssh folder?
* Have they created an authorized_keys file -- is this spelt correctly?!
* In the authorized_keys file have they correctly copied the public key (and not their private key, or saved a blank file etc.)?

If in doubt just generate a new keypair and try copying that...

### Issue with installing Azure CLI SSH extension (`az ssh`)
**This can also happen with other python conflicts**
Run `$ENV:PYTHONPATH = "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\CLI2"` and then try installing the extension with `az extension add -n ssh`.

Installation fails with pip error, running with --debug flag will show problem with winreg.XX function call (file not found). Issue is caused by conflicting Anaconda libraries being included by Azure CLI during extension install.

Temporarily change Anaconda directory to prevent conflict during extension installation:
* Change: `C:/Users/<username>/anaconda3` to `C:/Users/<username>/anaconda3_temp`
* Retry ssh extension installation `az ssh ...`
* Revert anaconda3 directory name back to original

### `az ssh` extension stops working after update
After updating, ssh extension stops working ("no module named 'rpds.rpds'")

Reinstall ssh extension: `az extension remove -n ssh && az extension add -n ssh"`
